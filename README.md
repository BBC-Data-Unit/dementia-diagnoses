In December 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50394258) some parts of the UK had seen the number of people diagnosed with dementia more than double in five years, according to analysis of NHS data.

A drive to increase diagnosis rates and an ageing population were behind the increase, experts said.

Charities said dementia care provision must improve, calling it a "ridiculous lottery", and "very hit or miss".

NHS England said it was a priority to diagnose dementia earlier so people could receive correct treatment.
